## Background

This template is the set of things we (the Ackama Ruby team) want in **every**
Rails application we create, based on 10+ years of creating new Rails
applications, numerous pen-tests and then maintaining those applications for
years.

Some of these choices are objectively good ideas, some of them are subjective
opinions :shrug:. We are delighted when other teams find this template useful as
either the starting point for their apps, or as the starting point for creating
their own in-house template.

## Features

Where possible we stick to Rails defaults.

- General
  - [puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) as application server
  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing JS packages
  - PostgreSQL as database. This template only supports PostgreSQL.
  - A much-improved `bin/setup` script
  - Install [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)
  - Create a `doc/` directory for docs
  - Add a middleware to implement HTTP Basic Auth by setting environment
    variables. We use this regularly for pre-production envs.
  - Use [okcomputer](https://github.com/sportngin/okcomputer) for health check
    endpoints. Configured in
    [./variants/backend-base/config/initializers/health_checks.rb](./variants/backend-base/config/initializers/health_checks.rb)
  - Install [lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge) for better logs in
    production.
  - Create `app/services` as the place to hold our plain ol' Ruby objects
    wherein we put most of our business logic.
  - Override the default ActiveStorage base controller to force the team to make
    a decision about whether ActiveStorage files must be behind authentication
    or not. The default Rails behaviour here can be a security gotcha.
- Security
  - Configure [`osv-detector`](https://github.com/G-Rath/osv-detector) to run in
    CI
  - Install and configure [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman)
  - Create `.well-known/security.txt`
  - Add a well documented
    [Content Security Policy initializer](./variants/backend-base/config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb)
    with secure defaults.
  - Install [pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) as our preferred
    authorization gem
- Error reporting
  - Setup Sentry for error reporting
- Code style
  - Add [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) config file
    ([.editorconfig](./editorconfig))
  - JS/HTML/CSS: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), Set up with an
    [Ackama prettier config](https://github.com/ackama/prettier-config-ackama)
    and a variety of other prettier plugins, see the full list in
    [variants/frontend-base/template.rb](./variants/frontend-base/template.rb)
  - JavaScript: [ESlint](https://eslint.org/), Ackama uses the rules found at
    [eslint-config-ackama](https://github.com/ackama/eslint-config-ackama)
    Styles: [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)
  - Ruby: [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop), with
    [ackama rubocop settings](./rubocop.yml.tt)
  - Install [Overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) for managing custom
    git hooks. Configure it with our default settings:
    [overcommit.yml](./overcommit.yml)
- General testing
  - RSpec for tests
  - Install [webdrivers](https://github.com/titusfortner/webdrivers)
  - Install [Simplecov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) for test
    coverage. Configures it with our defaults.
  - Debug system specs using a visible browser (not headless) by adding
    `HEADFUL=1` environment variable to your command line
- Accessibility testing - sets up automated accessibility testing.
  - Install [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) and
    [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to provide
    comprehensive coverage.
    - Axe Matchers is a gem that provides cucumber steps and rspec matchers that
      will check the accessibility compliance of your views. We require a
      default standard of wcag2a and wcag2aa.
    - We recommend that your tests all live in a `spec/features/accessibility`,
      to allow for running them separately. Using the shared examples found at
      `variants/accessibility/spec/support/shared_examples/an_accessible_page.rb`
      for your base tests avoids duplication and misconfiguration.
  - Install our
    [lighthouse matchers](https://github.com/ackama/lighthouse-matchers) gem
    which provide RSpec matchers to assess the accessibility compliance of your
    application.
    - We recommend setting your passing score threshold to 100 for new projects.
      As with Axe, you can keep your test suite tidy by placing these tests in
      `spec/features/accessibility`.
- Front-end
  - Rename `app/javascript` to `app/frontend`
  - Setup Shakapacker (the maintained fork of Webpacker).
  - > **Note** We are trialing the new JS packaging options that Rails 7+
    > provides. For now our default is still Shakapacker because it provides us
    > the most flexibility.
  - Initializes Ackama's linting and code formatting settings, see
    [Code linting and formatting](#code-linting-and-formatting)
- Performance testing
  - Add configuration and specs to use to perform a
    [lighthouse performance](https://web.dev/performance-scoring/) audit,
    requiring a score of at least 95.
- N+1 queries
  - Install & configure [bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet) to help
    prevent N+1 queries
- Devise (optional)
  - Install devise and tweak the configuration. if enabled in the configuration
    file.
  - Configure devise to destroy session cookies on log out (this comes up
    regularly in penetration tests)
- Bootstrap (optional)
  - Installs and configures
    [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
    if enabled in the configuration file.
- React (optional)
  - Add configuration and example components if enabled in the configuration
    file.
  - Based on [rails-react](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails)
  - The relevant config files are found in `variants/frontend-react`.
  - An example react test using
    [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
    is provided. Before you start adding more tests, it is recommended you read
    [common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)
- Typescript (optional)
  - Install and configure Typescript including linting
- Sidekiq (optional)
  - Install and configure Sidekiq

## Other templates

Some functionality which isn't something we need on every app is available in
our other templates:

- [Rails template to enable SSL/TLS for local development](https://github.com/ackama/rails-template-ssl-local-dev)
- [Rails template to render PDFs using Puppeteer and Chrome](https://github.com/ackama/rails-template-pdf-rendering)

## Requirements

Before running this template, you must have the following installed on your
machine:

- Yarn v1.21.0 or later
- Rails 7.0.x

The following are not strictly required to run the template but you will need it
to start the Rails app that this template creates:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

## How do I use this?

This template requires a YAML configuration file to to configure options. It
will use a file called `ackama_rails_template.config.yml` in your current
working directory if it exists. Otherwise you can specify a path using the
`CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

[ackama_rails_template.config.yml](./ackama_rails_template.config.yml) is a
documented configuration example that you can copy.

To generate a Rails application using this template, pass the `--template`
option to `rails new`, like this:

```bash
# Ensure you have the latest version of Rails
$ gem install rails

# Example 1
# #########

# Create a config file using the example
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ackama/rails-template/main/ackama_rails_template.config.yml

# Tweak the config file as you see fit

# Create a new app using the template. Template options will be taken from
# ./ackama_rails_template.config.yml
$ rails new my_app --no-rc --database=postgresql --skip-javascript --template=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ackama/rails-template/main/template.rb

# Example 2
# #########

# Create a custom config YAML file, saving as ./my_custom_config.yml

# Template options will be taken from ./my_custom_config.yml
$ CONFIG_PATH=./my_custom_config.yml rails new my_app --no-rc --database=postgresql --skip-javascript --template=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ackama/rails-template/main/template.rb
```

Here are some additional options you can add to this command. We don't
_prescribe_ these, but you may find that many Ackama projects are started with
some or all of these options:

- `--skip-action-mailbox` skips the setup of ActionMailbox, which you don't need
  unless you are receiving emails in your application.
- `--skip-active-storage` skips the setup of ActiveStorage. If you don't need
  support for file attachments, this can be skipped.
- `--skip-action-cable` - if you're not doing things with Websockets, you may
  want to consider skipping this one to avoid having an open websocket
  connection without knowing about it.

## How do I use this template for every Rails app I create?

The `rails` command will pull options from a `.railsrc` file in your home
directory. These options will be applied as arguments each time you run
`rails new` (unless you pass the `--no-rc` option).

To make this the default Rails application template on your system, create a
`~/.railsrc` file with these contents:

```
# ~/.railsrc
-d postgresql
--skip-javascript
-m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ackama/rails-template/main/template.rb
```

Once you've installed this template as your default, then all you have to do is
run:

```bash
$ rails new my-awesome-app
```

## Contributing

This project works by hooking into the standard Rails
[application templates](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html)
system, with some caveats. The entry point is the
[template.rb](https://github.com/ackama/rails-template/blob/main/template.rb)
file in the root of this repository.

Normally, Rails only allows a single file to be specified as an application
template (i.e. using the `-m <URL>` option). To work around this limitation, the
first step this template performs is a `git clone` of the
`ackama/rails-template` repository to a local temporary directory.

This temporary directory is then added to the `source_paths` of the Rails
generator system, allowing all of its ERb templates and files to be referenced
when the application template script is evaluated.

Rails generators are very lightly documented; what you'll find is that most of
the heavy lifting is done by [Thor](http://whatisthor.com/). Thor is a tool that
allows you to easily perform command line utilities. The most common methods
used by this template are Thor's `copy_file`, `template`, and `gsub_file`. You
can dig into the well-organized and well-documented
[Thor source code](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor) to learn more. If any file
finishes with `.tt`, Thor considers it to be a template and places it in the
destination without the extension `.tt`.

```bash
# create new rails app in tmp/builds/enterprise using ci/configs/react.yml as
# configuration
$ CONFIG_PATH="ci/configs/react.yml" APP_NAME="enterprise" ./ci/bin/build-and-test

# or do it manually:
#
# CONFIG_PATH must be relative to the dir that the rails app is created in
# because the template is run by `rails new` which uses the rails app dir as
# it's working dir, hence the `../` at the start.
#
$ rm -rf mydemoapp && CONFIG_PATH="../ci/configs/react.yml" rails new mydemoapp -d postgresql --skip-javascript -m ./template.rb
```

Rubocop is configured for this repo and is run as part of CI. Run rubocop
locally via the usual method:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rubocop # optionally adding -A for autofixes
```
