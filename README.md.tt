# <%= app_name %>

This is a Rails <%= Rails.version %> app.

## Documentation

This README describes the purpose of this repository and how to set up a development environment. Other sources of documentation are as follows:

* UI and API designs are in `doc/`
* Server setup instructions are in `PROVISIONING.md`
* Staging and production deployment instructions are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Prerequisites

This project requires:

* Ruby <%= RUBY_VERSION %>, preferably managed using [rbenv][]
* PhantomJS (in order to use the [poltergeist][] gem)
* PostgreSQL must be installed and accepting connections

On a Mac, you can obtain all of the above packages using [Homebrew][].

If you need help setting up a Ruby development environment, check out this [Rails OS X Setup Guide](https://mattbrictson.com/rails-osx-setup-guide).

## Getting started

### bin/setup

Run the `bin/setup` script. This script will:

* Check you have the required Ruby version
* Install gems using Bundler
* Create local copies of `.env` and `database.yml`
* Create, migrate, and seed the database

### Run it!

1. Run `rake test` to make sure everything works.
2. Run `rails s` to start the Rails app.
