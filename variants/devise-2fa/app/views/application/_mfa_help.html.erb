  <h2>What is two-factor authentication?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way of adding security to your
      account, and preventing people from accessing your account - even if
      they have access to your email and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll need an app on your phone or a similar device that can generate
      a 6-digit "One Time Password" for you each time you sign in. We also
      recommend generating backup codes, which can each be used once to
      access your account if you aren't able to use an authenticator app.

      If you do think someone has access to your email and password, please
      contact us immediately.
